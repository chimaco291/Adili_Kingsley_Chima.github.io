							<h1>My Story and Data Story</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/story2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My name is Adili Kingsley Chima and I am a Data Analyst,an Entrepreneur and an Materials and Metallurgical Engineer. I come from a business-oriented where I learnt how to make money before I could talk,lol. I have always had love for new technology and logical reasoning,being able to understand obscure trends and confirm instincts has always been fascinating to me. Data Analysis was the solace to my insatiable thirst for knowledge, transforming large data into actionable plans and getting new ideas and information from data is a beauty. Using tools like spreadsheet applications(Excel,Google sheets),Data visualizations tool(Tableau,PowerBi) and Programming Languages like R and Python have greatly helped me hone my craft.</p>
							<p>I see Data Analysis as a tool for problem solving and understanding, over the years I have done series of projects ranging from Data exploration on a Covid-19 Dataset to Analysis on a Bikeshare Dataset. My most recent Project was on the Sales Analysis of my Enterprise where I was able to find out my best performing products, Annual profit,Net Worth of the business. The insights gathered enabled me make well-informed business decisions that resulted to a profit increase of over 100% in 6-months and a Business Valuation of +57% compared to the previous year.</p>
							<p>Being able to transform peoples live to the positive with Data is one of my goal as a Data Analyst, I see data as an invaluable assets that is capable of changing the world. The Learning curve is an Adventure that everyone should participate in. </p>
